+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + +

The game would feature Asymmetric Gameplay

There’s a Defensive Player (DP) and an Aggressive player (AP)

DP controls a small number (Current proposal: 13) powerful and versatile characters, which if lost are gone for good

AP controls disposable units they draw from a stack, and continue to draw each turn.

 Most of AP’s units are simple troops, but a few are specialists with a singular ability.  This ability can either focus on attacking or affecting the board.

The DP will feature the most control pre-game, affecting the board layout with the use of preparations. 

While the AP will feature the most control during a game, but will be facing unknown odds.

AP’s Goal is to use their troops to secure a route from the bottom of the board to the top

DP’s Goal is to prevent AP from winning for a certain number of turns

The board takes place in a Circular town with an entry to the north and south

Spaces on the board are represented by town squares (Nodes) and connecting roads (lanes)

Nodes have a tile that is placed on them. One side is blank, the other is either blank or features a preparation.

Three major routes run through the town; through the center and around the sides

The center route starts with major blockades that must be dismantled

The Side routes take longer and cannot be used as a secured route

The rest of the town is a maze of Nodes and lanes, joining and splitting at Nodes along the way

+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + +

DP has the most control pre-game; having direct control over what units they command and the ability to affect the layout of the board.

DP would have access to a set currency of Prep-time to affect the board. They would be able to choose from a series of preparations, each with prep-time cost. The DP can then replace any of the Node Tiles with a prep-side down Node Tiles. AP will not know if a Node has a preparation until they land on the tile.

DP can choose a set number of characters (currently 13) out of a larger roaster

Each of DP’s units can move, attack, and each make use a unique ability

DP’s units should be able to easily destroy the AP’s Troop units from afar (a lane away?)

The DP’s Units should be hardy and take more than one attempt to remove them from the board

(Idea: each of the 13 has a normal state and an injured state. After this they are dead)

(Idea: AP cannot see what characters DP has chosen until AP’s troops have landed on one, and only know that one)

AP has the most control during the game

This player starts at the bottom of the board

AP draws a certain number of unit tokens from a mixed stack.

AP can choose to sacrifice a certain number of tokens to draw to pick a specific specialist.

Troop tokens can only move one space at a time, but act to secure that Space

Troop tokens can only attack by landing on the space of a DP character, but are then eliminated

Specialist tokens can either feature an attack ability or a board ability

Attack Specialists may have abilities like; being able to survive a single attack or attack from afar

Board Specialists may have abilities like; removing a preparation or create new lanes in specific places.

+ + + + Story Basics + + + +
+ + + + + + + + + + + + + +

In the three crowns setting there are three major kingdoms. In the history of the setting, one kingdom (The Huang Empire) launched an invasion to take over the world. After taking southern lands of its merchant neighbor nation by surprise, the invading empire found itself bottle necked by a stretch of impassible land. Forced to take the only safe road through this land, the marching army found itself at the town of Lonelywood. A town half way through the impassible lands and where a group of drifters in the merchant nation had gathered. Thirteen Gunmen of Demigod strength and Fortitude, wielding thirteen divine firearms, stood in the path of the empire. Why they did this, no one knows. As the Thirteen Gunmen served no nation and only ever used their powers to hunt those who did wrong. But still, they had prepared to hold the empire at this town of wood within a void of grass.

What resulted from this confrontation was the nation's most famous stand-off between the 13 gunmen and the endless numbers of the empire's marching army. The empire sported a brilliant, but stubborn, General, endless poorly armed conscripts, and various highly specialized and heavily armed strike squads. The thirteen Gunmen each hold a different set of abilities, but all were the best of the best with their chosen weapons and held an endless supply of ammunition for their divine weaponry. 
In the end, thousands of the empire's army died vs. five of the Gunmen dead or critically wounded and half the town ablaze. A subordinate of the General subdued his leader, tired of the endless bloodshed of his countrymen for a single town and sounded the retreat. The general himself was put on trial and sentenced to hang for his great incompetence. Not long after, the Empire's engineers built the world's first zeppelins and flew the army over the stretch of land, but the time bought by the 13 gunman was enough for the merchant nation to prepare for the oncoming war.
